You can make your model considerably more powerful by careful feature
engineering for timeseries data.

Sources: - <https://www.kaggle.com/learn/time-series> -

Main ideas: - Add calendar periodic features - Need to combine test and
train data together for this to work properly - Add autoregressive
features - Augment with external data: - Currency exchange rate - Census
(there are predictive data for this)
